  "description": "The MQTT v5 client library is implemented using C++(17) programming language, but provides C interface. The library's code doesn't use RTTI or exceptions, but by default the library's implementation uses C++ STL data types, such as std::string and std::vector. However, it is possible to compile the library not to use any dynamic memory allocation, and make it suitable for bare-metal environment without any heap.",
